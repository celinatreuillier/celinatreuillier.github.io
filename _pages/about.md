I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the [Human-IST institute](https://human-ist.unifr.ch/), from the [Université de Fribourg](https://www.unifr.ch/home/fr/), Switzerland. 

My research focuses on **Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence**, **User Experience**, **User Modeling** and **Trustworthy AI**. I prioritize a human-centered approach in my work, carefully considering the influence and impact of AI on users. 
I take a multidisciplinary approach, collaborating closely with researchers in social sciences, psychology, *etc.*

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr/en/) from the [Université de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/) (France), under the supervision of [Armelle Brun](https://members.loria.fr/ABrun/) and [Sylvain Castagnos](https://members.loria.fr/scastagnos/files/index.html). My Ph.D. was centered on News Recommender Systems and their connection to political polarization. I had the great opportunity to join the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.ntnu.edu/idi) of the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/) as a visiting researcher from August 2023 to December 2023. 

I hold a Master’s degree in Cognitive Science from Université de Lorraine(France) where I developed expertise in AI, Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, and Neuroscience. The multidisciplinary nature of my academic journey has been a key strength, blending computer science with cognitive science perspectives.


Beyond my research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring, having guided students through various projects and courses in AI, data visualization, and related fields. I am also always eager to get involved in the research community, serving as a reviewer for prominent journals and contributing to collaborative efforts that advance the field (*e.g.* workshop organization).

Outside of academia, I’m a passionate sports enthusiast. Whether it’s running, swimming, cycling, hiking, or horseback riding, you’ll often find me outdoors, staying active and enjoying nature! 🚵‍♀️🏃🏼‍♀️🏊‍♀️🏇
